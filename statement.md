Project Statement: Dormitory Care Tracker

1. Introduction

So, imagine this. You run a huge dormitory. Hundreds of students. It is a critical responsibility. But managing their health? A total nightmare. We used to use paper. Just stacks of logbooks. It was inefficient. If a student gets sick, good luck finding their file. The paper tears. Ink fades. It’s bad. The Dormitory Care Tracker is here to fix that mess. It is a digitized solution for wardens who are tired of the chaos.

2. The Problem

Here is the thing about the old manual sytems. They are broken.
You write the same thing five times. Data redundancy is everywhere. And when you need to find a kid's emergency contact? You are flipping through pages for twenty minutes. Slow retrieval.
Also, paper is weak. It lacks persistence. A cup of coffee spills, and the record is destroyed. Gone forever. plus, handwriting is terrible. You can't read half of it. Inconsistency is the norm.

3. The Fix

We built the Dormitory Care Tracker. It is a Python CLI app. Simple. Efficient.
It streamlines everything. We made a centralized digital repository. No more loose papers. Student details, medical profiles, room numbers. It is all stored securely in a structured JSON format.

Key Objectives:

Digitalization: We take the physical logs. We make them digital.

Accessibility: You need a name? You type it. Instant access.

Persistence: The data survives. Even if you restart the computer. It is file-based storage.

User-Friendliness: It’s menu-driven. Even non-technical staff can use it without a headache.

4. How It Works (Technically)

We kept it simple. Standard Python libraries. High portability.
We use Python 3.x. It is the standard.
For storage, we use JSON. It is human-readable. It keeps the data persistant in student_wellness_data.json.

The Code Stuff:

json: For saving the records.

os: Checks if files exist. Manages paths.

datetime: Timestamps. So we know when it happened.

5. What You Can Do

The app does the heavy lifting.
Data Entry: You input the profile.

Identity: Name, ID, Age. Who are they?

Accommodation: Block, Room Number. Where do they sleep?

Medical Profile: Blood Group, Allergies. The important stuff.

Consultation History: Did they see a doctor? Write it down.

Data Persistence: It saves automatically. You load it up, the records are there. No data loss.
Search Functionality: You query the database. Type a name or ID. It finds the specific entrys instantly.
Summary View: A table showing everyone. A quick snapshot.

6. Conclusion

The Dormitory Care Tracker is solid. It provides a robust foundation.
We are moving from paper to digital. It ensures better data integrity. Faster response times in emergencies. It just makes administrative oversight easier. No more mess.
