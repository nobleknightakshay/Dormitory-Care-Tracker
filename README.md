# Dormitory-Care-Tracker
This Python CLI script manages dormitory health records. It allows users to add detailed student profiles—including room info, allergies, and doctor visits—saved to a text file. Users can search by Name/ID, view summary lists, and track medical history via an interactive menu. It is a lightweight, offline tool for monitoring resident well-being.
